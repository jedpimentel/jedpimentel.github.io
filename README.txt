Thanks for reading about me!

I'm currently learning Web Development via freecodecamp.com. Making this portfolio was my last requirement for the freeCodeCamp Front-End certification. The certificate is only worth the code that was written to obtain it, so I took my time not to rush anything (though I'm still embarrassed by some of my earlier code).

As-is, this portfolio is mainly done to meet the following problem statement:
http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage

I plan to modify this portfolio in the future.

To-do:
	make a personal favicon.ico
	change the portfolio item container for a flexbox (justify-content: "space-around" seems good).
